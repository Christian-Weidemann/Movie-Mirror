# Movie Mirror
A movie recommendation project using network analysis methods.

## MovieLens 100k rating data
We use the [movielens-100k_rating data](https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/): a bipartite network consisting of 100,000 ratings by 943 users for 1682 movies. An edge between a user and a movie is weighed with the rating (on a 1 to 5 scale). Users were sampled randomly, and users with fewer than 20 ratings were discarded in construction the data set. Movies each have at least one rating. The data was collected from the MovieLens website between 1997 and 1998.
