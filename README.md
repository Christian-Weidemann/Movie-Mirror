## Netflix Prize data
Netflix held the Netflix Prize open competition for the best algorithm to predict user ratings for films. 
For this they released a representative sample of movie ratings between 1998 and 2005, consisting of 480,189 users rating 17,770 movies. Ratings were on a 5 star (1-5) scale. The data additionally contains the date of each rating, which we won't use.

We use the data to construct a bipartite undirected network, where ratings are edge weights.
